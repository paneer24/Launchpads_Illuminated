# SpaceX Launch Sites Location Analysis with Folium

## Project Overview

In this project, I have utilized Folium to map the locations of SpaceX launch sites. The main objectives include:

1. **Task 1: Mark all launch sites on a map.**
2. **Task 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map.**
3. **Task 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site and its proximities.**

## Project Structure

- `data`: The data is from spacex_launch_geo.csv
- `notebooks`: I have attached  Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
