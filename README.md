# SpaceX Launch Sites Location Analysis with Folium

## Project Overview

In this project, I have utilized Folium to map the locations of SpaceX launch sites. The main objectives include:

1. **Task 1: Mark all launch sites on a map.**
2. **Task 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map.**
3. **Task 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site and its proximities.**

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks.
- `results/`: Output and visualizations.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Execute the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `notebooks/` and `scripts/` directories.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
