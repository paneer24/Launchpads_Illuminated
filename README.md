In this project I have used folium to map the locations of SPACEX launch sites.
There are mainly three objectives in this project
TASK 1:Mark all launch sites on a map
TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities
